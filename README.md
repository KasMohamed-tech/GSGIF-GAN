## Abstract 
<p align="justify">
Information fusion, especially in image-based applications, plays an important role in various domains such as robotics, biomedicine, situation awareness, and remote sensing. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Generic Saliency-Guided Image Fusion GAN (GSGIF-GAN), to address the challenges associated with generic image fusion. The proposed method leverages a self-supervised learning dataset based on a saliency mechanism, eliminating the need for extensive annotations. Two key contributions are presented: first, a self-supervised learning dataset construction based on saliency-driven information distibution constructing input sources, and second, a feature-level loss function for training a generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fusion model. The performance of the proposed GSGIF-GAN is proved against well-known SOTA works devoted to generic image fusion. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations are performed on three image fusion tasks that are visible and infrared fusion, multi-focus fusion, and multi-modal medical image  fusion. The quantitative evaluations are based on six image fusion metrics proposed in the literature and we proposed a ranking strategy to disclose overall performance and stability comparison.  Furthermore, we conducted two other experiments to prove the generalizability of the proposed framework regarding the number of input sources to fuse as well as its certainty during the training.
